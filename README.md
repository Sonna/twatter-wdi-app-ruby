## Overview

Build a website using the Sinatra framework that demonstrates a Create Retrieve
Update Delete (CRUD) application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database via
ActiveRecord, with at least 3 models with associations (excluding the User).

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- ActiveRecord
- Git
- GitHub.com
- Heroku
- PostgreSQL

## Features

- Twats (aka Tweets)
- Retwats
- Like Twats
- Comment
- Follow User's Twats
- Block Users
- Users


## Future design plans

Fix the tests the were broken on the last day, since I did not feel at the time
there was enough demonstrable functionality within the website and opted for
implementing features, rather than testing first in the last 24 hour period. If
it were an actual deliverable product I would rather cut features and deliver
them at a later date through updates.
